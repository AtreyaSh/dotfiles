#+STARTUP: overview

** Tasks
*** Dotfiles
***** TODO standardize or make uniform colors among i3blocks blocklets -> check exact hexes
***** TODO try to replace $HOME with tilde for standardization -> including for readme
***** TODO bash/zsh fix reduced hard-coding -> add if statements to check for certain commands to reduce hard-coding
***** reduce the number of dotfiles for a leaner installation
***** consider using different configs for remote and local shells
***** keep gnupg, ssh, neomutt and other directories in private stow repo

*** System reproducibility
***** TODO Root files need to be added via hard files, migrate them to separate system local repo which holds package lists and installation script to revert things back to current state, use gnu install for those commands, make simple root install script which uses directory structure for installs, migrate system reproducibility log to this repo 
***** work on install script which setps up all the necessary git repos for dotfiles that cannot be managed with submodules -> eg. vim, spacemacs etc.
***** work on update script which updates all submodules and git repos to latest upstream commits (git submodule update --init --recursive --remote), and also updates misc. code bases such as melpa, vim, spacemacs, etc.
***** work on script which returns arch linux OS state to current state using package list backups, dotfile installation scheme and notes for important steps taken from experience -> test this with virtual machine -> perhaps each update backs up package list as well
***** make all audio channels muted at boot (now only main channel is muted)
***** check if possible to flash open dpms when recovering from suspend where lock resulted in dpms down
***** synchronize mime system program defaults to same as ranger's rifle
***** figure out how to dump all package names and associated systemd rules which need to be recreated
      
** System reproduction logs after basic Arch installation
**** sudo
***** install `sudo`
***** add or uncomment the following `%wheel      ALL=(ALL) ALL` to allow for wheel users to access sudo
***** use `visudo` to prevent any syntax errors
**** tlp runner
***** instal `tlp` 
***** copy existing tlp.conf to /etc/tlp.conf for disabling bluetooth, wifi and wwan at startup
***** run `sudo systemctl enable tlp.service` and `sudo systemctl start tlp.service`  
**** light
***** install `light` for managing backlight
***** add local user to `video` group by running `usermod -a -G video shankar`  
**** mesa video driver
***** install `mesa` package and avoid `xf86-video-intel`
**** udev battery rules
***** copy 60-onbattery.rules and 61-onpower.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d
***** reload rules `sudo udevadm control --reload`
**** ufw firewall
***** install `ufw` 
***** retain default settings that deny incoming requests while allowing outgoing
***** run `sudo systemctl enable ufw.service` and `sudo systemctl start ufw.service`
***** run `sudo ufw enable` to enable it outside systemd
**** openssh
***** install `openssh`
***** run `systemctl --user enable ssh-agent.service` and `systemctl --user start ssh-agent.service` on local file
***** SSH_AUTH_SOCK environmental variable needs to be set in shellrc
***** stow ~/.ssh/config with instructions for adding keys to ssh agent
**** gnupg
***** install `gnupg`
***** stow ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent to get relevant agent functionalities and cached keys, along with shell GPG_TTY environmental variable
**** ACPI audio jack
***** install `acpid`
***** copy `audio_jack` to /etc/acpi/events
***** run `sudo sytemctl enable acpid.service` and `sudo sytemctl start acpid.service`
**** pre-suspend i3lock workflow
***** all i3lock scripts have `sleep 0.1` to prevent i3 mode from being captured in screenshot
***** i3lock post-suspend requires sleep to prevent short real display
***** copy suspend@.service to /etc/systemd/system
***** run `sudo systemctl enable suspend@$USER.service`, remember to replace $USER with the actual user 
**** early KMS
***** add `MODULES=(intel_agp i915)` to /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
***** run `sudo mkinitcpio -P`
**** timesync
***** run `sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd.service` in order to sync time
**** fonts
***** install `ttf-dejavu`,`ttf-font-awesome`, `otf-font-awesome` and AUR `nerd-fonts-bitstream-vera-mono` for terminal font
***** update cache using `fc-cache -fv`
***** i3 uses fc-match to find best font which mostly ends up defaulting to `DejaVu Sans`, which is why it appears as a default
      
** Completed
***** DONE find out i3 default working font and name it properly
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 15:44]
***** DONE find ways to reduce hard-coding of configs/dotfiles to `/home/shankar` or `~`
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 02:22]
***** DONE extract all steps listed in i3 config file for reproducibility -> store them neatly with explanations and commands
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 19:19]
***** DONE move all special files elsewhere and add jack file as well
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 15:01]
***** DONE improve quality and formatting of all code, especially for i3 configs
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 14:47]
***** DONE change layout names to more agnostic -> make this better
      CLOSED: [2020-11-05 Thu 13:53]
***** DONE change background name to simpler one and synchronize throughout all references
      CLOSED: [2020-11-05 Thu 13:18]
***** DONE replace simple git repos with submodules -> only done for non-offensive git repos
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 17:15]
***** DONE Design non-offending stow command for all -> put this in readme
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 16:14]
***** DONE Dotfile initiative started
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 16:14]
