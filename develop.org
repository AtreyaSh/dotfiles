#+STARTUP: overview
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

** Tasks
*** Dotfiles
**** Current
***** TODO bash/zsh fix reduced hard-coding -> add if statements to check for certain commands to reduce hard-coding (eg. ranger and neomutt) -> put aliases in dedicated files for both bash and zsh
***** TODO reduce redundant code in bash/zsh and clean workflows up -> would require understanding each line
***** make all audio channels muted at boot (now only main channel is muted)
***** consider using different configs for remote and local shells -> perhaps section them into core, personal etc.
***** hook to shfmt on all shell scripts including zsh
***** clean up =~/.spacemacs.d= and make it organized as per blogpost with various sections -> use consistent naming practices and perhaps rename elpy submodule to something that fits semantically

**** Long-term
***** use pam environment to cache passphrase for ssh and gpg keys
***** problems with xset dpms when waking from sleep -> perhaps add sleep 1 and then wake dpms
***** fix spacemacs conflicts with auto-completion and elpy -> also improve general company autocompletion flow and trigger it only on user request
***** work on improving personal org mode tricks and standards
***** special shell-check to ensure all shell tildes are replaced with $HOME
***** synchronize mime system program defaults to same as ranger's rifle
***** reduce the number of dotfiles for a leaner installation
***** consider running emacs as a service to have everything synchronized in one run
***** port gnupg, ssh, neomutt private dotfiles to private stow repo

*** System reproducibility
***** work on update script which updates all submodules and git repos to latest upstream commits eg. =git submodule update --init --recursive --remote=, and also updates misc. code bases such as melpa, vim, spacemacs, etc.
***** work on install script which sets up all the necessary git repos for dotfiles that cannot be managed with submodules
      
** Completed
***** DONE add upstream vim as submodule and then simply source it cleanly + check if somehow possible for spacemacs too (change to .spacemacs.d) -> consider removing env file
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 15:31]
***** DONE add public ssh and gnupg dotfiles, find a way to source additional file from ssh config
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 13:27]
***** DONE remove multiple vimrcs and keep only my_configs.vim for simplicity
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 03:52]
***** DONE consider doing away with .profile if not necessary -> or make this leaner -> lowercase all zshrc comments
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 02:37]
***** DONE replace tilde with $HOME for standardization in shell scripts -> $HOME is safer as it can be quoted and because it works generally anywhere in a string -> also allows your code to be more portable
      CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 17:16]
***** DONE check if possible to flash open dpms when recovering from suspend where lock resulted in dpms down
      CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 01:40]
***** DONE standardize or make uniform colors among i3blocks blocklets -> check exact hexes
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 16:06]
***** DONE find out i3 default working font and name it properly
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 15:44]
***** DONE find ways to reduce hard-coding of configs/dotfiles to =/home/shankar= or =~=
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 02:22]
***** DONE extract all steps listed in i3 config file for reproducibility -> store them neatly with explanations and commands
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 19:19]
***** DONE move all special files elsewhere and add jack file as well
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 15:01]
***** DONE improve quality and formatting of all code, especially for i3 configs
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 14:47]
***** DONE change layout names to more agnostic -> make this better
      CLOSED: [2020-11-05 Thu 13:53]
***** DONE change background name to simpler one and synchronize throughout all references
      CLOSED: [2020-11-05 Thu 13:18]
***** DONE replace simple git repos with submodules -> only done for non-offensive git repos
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 17:15]
***** DONE Design non-offending stow command for all -> put this in readme
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 16:14]
***** DONE Dotfile initiative started
