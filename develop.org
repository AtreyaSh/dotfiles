** Tasks
*** Dotfiles
**** Current
***** TODO i3: make all audio channels muted at boot (now only main channel is muted) -> very complicated because of pulseaudio and alsa simultaneous actions: https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-utils/issues/72
***** zsh/bash: modify up key to refresh history cache for history search, current behaviour requires enter to be pressed -> see https://superuser.com/questions/843138/how-can-i-get-zsh-shared-history-to-work/844048#844048
****** workaround already found to update history file on each enter command (with =setopt shared_history= for zsh and extra prompt commands for bash)
***** emacs: improve autocompletions of latex layer: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/14134
****** wrong order of company-completions -> brute-force solution is to create new layer
****** lighter solution is to modify =company-backends= variable post-initialization
 
**** Long-term
***** emacs
****** clean up =~/.spacemacs.d= and make it organized as per blogpost with various sections -> will take time and effort
****** think about improving workflow to handle spaces, make case unsensitive and parse bibliography codes better (eg. "doran2017does" from "do") in =company-reftex-citation-candidates=, for development add package (eg. =(company-reftex :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "atreyasha/company-reftex"))=) in =dotspacemacs-additional-packages= and update packages, delete old package location
****** consider running emacs as a service to have everything synchronized in one run
****** migrate to lightweight and lean personal emacs configuration which would be optimized with time -> this might help circumvent many bugs encountered
***** i3
****** think about using xautolock/xss-lock to circumvent some manual pid checking and possibly extra sleep: https://github.com/i3/i3lock/issues/275
****** problems with xset dpms when waking from sleep -> perhaps add sleep 1 and then wake dpms
***** shell
****** bash: improve inputrc where possible and synchronize vim-mode with clipboard buffer
****** consider using different configs for remote and local shells by sectioning into personal, core, etc
****** hook to shfmt on all shell scripts including zsh
****** special shell-check to ensure all shell tildes are replaced with $HOME
***** mimeapps
****** synchronize mime system program defaults to same as ranger's rifle
***** system(d)
****** make scripts determine active $DISPLAY environmental variable instead of hard-coding -> use for cases where necessary
***** general
****** use pam environment to cache passphrase for ssh and gpg keys
****** port gnupg, ssh, neomutt private dotfiles to private stow repo
****** reduce the number of dotfiles for a leaner installation

*** System reproducibility
***** work on update script which updates all submodules and git repos to latest upstream commits eg. =git submodule update --init --recursive --remote=, and also updates misc. code bases such as melpa, vim, spacemacs, etc.
***** work on install script which sets up all the necessary git repos for dotfiles that cannot be managed with submodules
      
** Completed
***** DONE bash/zsh: reduce redundant code in bash/zsh and clean workflows up -> would require understanding each line and then deleting unnecessary ones -> bash more or less done, streamline further for zsh configs
      CLOSED: [2020-11-20 Fri 14:22]
***** DONE look into conflicting tabbing and insert behaviour for latex enumerate/itemize environment + newline on comments leading to comments becoming non-comments
      CLOSED: [2020-11-17 Tue 14:38]
***** DONE local hack: fix spacemacs conflicts with auto-completion and elpy -> also improve general company autocompletion flow and trigger it only on user request -> need to understand keybindings better to make this work
      CLOSED: [2020-11-14 Sat 13:05]
***** DONE add user flags to pgrep i3lock cases -> improve other shell scripts too
      CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 14:46]
***** DONE clear shell output when logging out -> useful for ssh connections, see debian template -> useful to have to override existing default which may be confusing -> don't do this
      CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 13:17]
***** DONE streamline and unify the usage of xsel and xclip -> decided to keep both options as both come in handy
      CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 12:57]
***** DONE fix tmux portability and xclip copy issues -> reverted to keep xsel
      CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 02:31]
***** DONE sort out gpg-agent forgetting keys issue -> most likely arises from reloadagent command in shell logout scripts
      CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 01:26]
***** DONE gpg-agent dying randomly again -> put GPG_TTY in .zshenv and somewhere important for bash -> add if statement for logout gpg-agent
      CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 20:32]
***** DONE invest in a minimal tmux configuration file
      CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 19:48]
***** DONE bash/zsh: clean up aliases and add if statements to check for certain commands to reduce hard-coding (eg. ranger and neomutt)
      CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 19:09]
***** DONE add upstream vim as submodule and then simply source it cleanly + check if somehow possible for spacemacs too (change to .spacemacs.d) -> consider removing env file
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 15:31]
***** DONE add public ssh and gnupg dotfiles, find a way to source additional file from ssh config
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 13:27]
***** DONE remove multiple vimrcs and keep only my_configs.vim for simplicity
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 03:52]
***** DONE consider doing away with .profile if not necessary -> or make this leaner -> lowercase all zshrc comments
      CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 02:37]
***** DONE replace tilde with $HOME for standardization in shell scripts -> $HOME is safer as it can be quoted and because it works generally anywhere in a string -> also allows your code to be more portable
      CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 17:16]
***** DONE check if possible to flash open dpms when recovering from suspend where lock resulted in dpms down
      CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 01:40]
***** DONE standardize or make uniform colors among i3blocks blocklets -> check exact hexes
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 16:06]
***** DONE find out i3 default working font and name it properly
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 15:44]
***** DONE find ways to reduce hard-coding of configs/dotfiles to =/home/shankar= or =~=
      CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 02:22]
***** DONE extract all steps listed in i3 config file for reproducibility -> store them neatly with explanations and commands
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 19:19]
***** DONE move all special files elsewhere and add jack file as well
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 15:01]
***** DONE improve quality and formatting of all code, especially for i3 configs
      CLOSED: [2020-11-07 Sat 14:47]
***** DONE change layout names to more agnostic -> make this better
      CLOSED: [2020-11-05 Thu 13:53]
***** DONE change background name to simpler one and synchronize throughout all references
      CLOSED: [2020-11-05 Thu 13:18]
***** DONE replace simple git repos with submodules -> only done for non-offensive git repos
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 17:15]
***** DONE Design non-offending stow command for all -> put this in readme
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 16:14]
***** DONE Dotfile initiative started
      CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 16:14]
